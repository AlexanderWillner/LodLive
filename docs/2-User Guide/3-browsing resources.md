Here you can follow the direct and inverse connections provided by the resource by moving freely from one "circle" to the others.

Every new pop-open resource will guide the user to those relating to it, automatically connecting the new "circle" to the ones they have already opened.

Every time an owl:sameAs property is reached throughout the course of navigation, LodLive will connect to the related endpoint, enabling the user to move to the new available resources within the same navigation environment.
